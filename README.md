# ℹ️ Overview

After Hours is the final project of my DIMA 346 Game Production class, and is a top-down horror experience designed to connect to themes of trauma, violence, and grief. My name is Reece Fish, and I am a senior at the University of St. Thomas, graduating with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science in Spring of 2026. After Hours was a partner project; my partner, Eli Goldberg, worked on all of the coding for this project, including the AI pathfinding, while I worked on both the visual and sound design of the game. The end goal of this game was to "Promote the Common Good", and connect to the mission of St. Thomas--to that effect, we decided to connect this game's themes to overcoming grief. This game wound up becoming a personal passion project, as I am a survivor of SA, and wanted to show part of my struggle to come to terms with my own past in the visual storytelling of the game. After Hours follows a young boy, who is trapped in a dream-like school setting, with never-ending halls of lockers, and a vague, looming threat sulking in the background. The player must guide this boy through this maze to find several key "levers" that open a door, which would ultimately lead to escape from this nightmare, and end the game. However, the monster grows increasingly aggressive, getting faster throughout the game in its pursuit, and even inverting the player's controls, causing confusion and panic. Through all of this, there is a heavy darkness across the screen that prevents users from seeing much of the path, and potentially hiding the monster until it is too late to escape. However, the player is not entirely helpless--they have the ability to block or even trap the monster with electrical fields they can summon from both behind and in front of them, appearing and disappearing for a short period of time. However, the user must also use these traps on the aforementioned levers in order to progress, and they can only be used again once they disappear, forcing the player to make a decision whether or not to protect themselves or escape. Though simplistic, I really connected with this project, and wanted to showcase it as one of my favorite achievements throughout my time at the University of St. Thomas.
